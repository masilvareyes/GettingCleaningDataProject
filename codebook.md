## Project Description
Creation of a tidy data with the average of the mean and std metrics from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The original data set could be find in the URL [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set")

##Creating the tidy datafile

For more information about how the dataset has been created please refer to the file [Readme.md](README.md)

##Description of the variables in the tidydata2.txt file
There are 66 metrics present in the data set, it was extracted only the mean or the standart deviation of the original data set and each metric was **averaged by activity and person**.
